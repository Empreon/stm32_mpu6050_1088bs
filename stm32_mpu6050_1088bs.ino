/*
Project: MPU6050 3D Angle Visualization on LED Matrices
This code obtains raw data from an MPU6050 inertial measurement unit (IMU)
using the I2C protocol for communication with an STM32 Nucleo-L053R8 board.
The raw data is processed using the Madgwick sensor fusion algorithm to
calculate orientation angles (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw).
These angles are then visualized on two LD1088BS 8x8 LED matrices,
driven by MAX7219 display driver ICs. Communication with the MAX7219 drivers
is handled via the SPI protocol from the STM32. The LED matrices aim to
represent the device's orientation on a conceptual 3D coordinate plane.
