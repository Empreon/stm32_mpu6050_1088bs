3D Angle Visualization with MPU6050 and LED Matrices

This project captures real-time 3D orientation data (yaw, pitch, and roll) from an MPU6050 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and visualizes it on a pair of 8x8 LED matrices. The system is controlled by an STM32 Nucleo-L053R8 microcontroller and leverages the MPU6050's onboard Digital Motion Processor (DMP) for efficient, high-performance angle calculations.

Features

Real-time Orientation Tracking: Accurately tracks yaw, pitch, and roll angles.

Efficient DMP Processing: Offloads complex sensor fusion algorithms from the microcontroller to the MPU6050's DMP, ensuring high responsiveness and stability.

Interrupt-Driven Architecture: A non-blocking main loop processes data only when signaled by an interrupt from the MPU6050, minimizing CPU load and preventing data loss (FIFO overflow).

3D Coordinate Visualization: Two 8x8 LED matrices are arranged to represent a 3D space:

Matrix 0: Displays Roll (X-axis) vs. Pitch (Y-axis).

Matrix 1: Displays Yaw (Z-axis) vs. Pitch (Y-axis).

Arduino IDE Compatible: The firmware is developed in the Arduino environment for ease of use and portability.

How It Works

Initialization: The setup() function initializes serial communication, the I2C bus, the MPU6050 sensor, and the MAX7219 display drivers.

DMP Firmware: It then loads the Digital Motion Processor firmware onto the MPU6050. This allows the sensor itself to perform the complex sensor fusion calculations, converting raw accelerometer and gyroscope data into stable quaternion values.

Calibration: A live calibration of the accelerometer and gyroscope is performed to ensure accuracy.

Interrupt-Driven Data Acquisition: The MPU6050 is configured to issue a hardware interrupt on its INT pin whenever a new packet of orientation data is available in its FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer. The STM32 listens for this interrupt.

Non-Blocking Loop: The main loop() does nothing until the interrupt flag is set. This is highly efficient.

Data Processing: Once an interrupt is detected, the STM32 reads the data packet from the MPU's FIFO buffer. It extracts the quaternion and calculates the final yaw, pitch, and roll angles in degrees.

Visualization: The yaw, pitch, and roll angles (ranging from -90 to +90 degrees) are mapped to the 8x8 grid of the LED matrices. A single LED is lit on each matrix to represent the device's current orientation in the conceptual 3D space.

Installation and Usage

Hardware: Assemble the circuit according to the Wiring and Connections section.

IDE Setup: Install the Arduino IDE and add support for STM32 boards using the Boards Manager.

Install Libraries: Install the i2cdevlib and LedControl libraries. You can do this via the Arduino Library Manager or by downloading the repositories and adding them to your libraries folder.

Upload Code: Open the stm32_mpu6050_1088bs.ino file in the Arduino IDE. Select your STM32 board and the correct COM port.

Run: Upload the code. Open the Serial Monitor at 115200 baud. You will be prompted to send any character to begin the DMP calibration and start the program.

Visualize: Tilt the MPU6050 sensor and observe the corresponding LEDs light up on the two matrices.
